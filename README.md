Welcome to my portfolio site!

It may not be the best portfolio site around but this one is mine and im proud of what I was able to do with it at the time.

I still plan on improving and added things to my portfolio, as I build out other projects or join new teams.

## Built with:
currently this project was only built with react.js and github pages, for the momment it was all that I needed to complete this portfolio though i would love to refactor and make improvements or even re-do the CSS down the line.

### why?

i am a person who loves concepts and ideas, often loving to try and impliment them but with no real good regiment of my own a lot of my projects fade into obscurity while the knowledge of its development i keep throughout the years.
